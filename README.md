Predicting Football Match Outcomes
This project aims to predict the outcome of upcoming football matches (particularly the Premier League) using historical data. It employs a straightforward classification model (e.g., Random Forest) in Python, focusing on data preprocessing, feature selection, and result prediction.

Goal
Forecast match results (home win, draw, away win) based on past match data

Build a model capable of making new predictions for future games, even when only team names are known

Key Components
Data: A CSV file (PremierLeague.csv) with historical matches (date, home/away teams, goals, etc.)

Libraries: Python 3, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib 

Model: A classification algorithm trained on historical records, producing accuracy, confusion matrices, and probabilities for each outcome

Usage
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the script or notebook to:

Load and clean the CSV data

Encode team names

Train the model on past results

Predict future matches by creating a simple DataFrame with upcoming fixtures. The model will output the predicted class (home win, draw, away win) and probabilities.

Observations
Simple features (like just team names) may result in low accuracy. More detailed data (team form, betting odds, injuries) typically improves predictions.

Time-based validation helps prevent information leakage.

This demo project shows how machine learning can be applied to sports predictions but is yet to achieve professional-grade accuracy.
